Introduction
-
Before starting this project I'd like to state that I've never worked with Python or Django before.

Therefore this project has been an exciting challenge for me!
Within a day I've learned to use the basics of Python and Django and then started working on this project.

Requirements
-
Create three pages (URLs) where:
- The first page will be able to upload my chosen ".csv file".
- The second page will display the .csv as a database with (NON-ADMIN) CRUD properties.
- The third and last page will display 3 visualizations taken from said database. 

Rules
-
- All logic and queries are done in "views.py"
- Database modeling is done in "models.py"
